# Image Match Using Local Features Methods. This Algorithm is from Paper: 

### Felix von Hundelshausen and Rahul Sukthankar, "D-Nets: Beyond Patch-Based Image Descriptors". In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012.

This Algorithm Source Codebase [D-Nets](https://sites.google.com/site/descriptornets/home/src/d-nets.cpp)

More details we can review this web [D-Nets Web] (https://sites.google.com/site/descriptornets/)

## Welcome to D-Nets & Color-D-Nets  

D-Nets details, you could review this code and read d-nets paper. Color-d-nets splits the image channels for matching and finally merges the results.

#### Environments : Visual Studio 2015 + OpenCV 2.4.11 + OpenCV-contrib(if you want to use sift-like descriptors to compare with this algorithm.)
